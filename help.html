        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> I messed up my controls in Panel Attack, and now it's going crazy. Help?</p>
        <p><span class="a">A:</span> Try clicking on the "Configure Input" menu item and then "Reset to default controls" with your mouse.
          </p><p>If that doesn't work you need to close Panel Attack and delete the file that saves your input settings.
          On windows, you can type this into the start menu search to get to the right folder:

        <div class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</div>

        then delete <span class="code">keysV2.txt</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flexItem">
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I set Player 2's controls for local play in Panel Attack?</p>
        <p><span class="a">A:</span>
          While in the place for setting controls, put your cursor on "Configuration" and press the right arrow or on screen button.
          You can set multiple control profiles and the first control method used for each player will be assigned while playing a match.

        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> I have two computers. Can I use the same Panel Attack ranking system
          user_id on both, so all my matches get tracked to the same account?</p>
        <p><span class="a">A:</span> Yes, please do. After you've logged into the Panel Attack server(s) once:
          <br>
          On your first computer, Go to "Options" "Modify User ID" and then "Main Server ID" and write down the number listed there.
          <br>
          Now go to the same spot on your second computer and type or paste that number in.
          <br>
          <br>
          Note: There is a manual way to do this below which you shouldn't need any more, but keeping in case you do.
          <br>
          Copy your "servers" folder to the appropriate location on your other computer.
          <br>Here are the folder locations, per operating system.
          <br><br>Make sure to replace "user" with whatever your operating system username is.
          <br>Windows 10, 8, 7, or Vista: <span class="code">C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Panel Attack</span> or search
          for <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack</span>
          <br>Mac: <span class="code">/Users/user/Library/Application Support/Panel Attack</span>
          <br>Linux: <span class="code">$XDG_DATA_HOME/Panel Attack</span> or <span
            class="code">~/.local/share/love/</span>
          <br>Windows XP <span class="code">C:\Documents</span> and <span class="code">Settings\user\Application
            Data\Panel Attack</span>
          <br>This folder contains your user_ids for each server, which Panel Attack uses to log in to the ranking
          system.

      <div class="flexItem">
        <p class="q"><span class="q">Q:</span> How do I access replays?</p>

        <p><span class="a">A:</span>Replays of all the games your client has played or spectated are stored as files on your computer
          in <span class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>
          <br>Publicly saved replays are <a href="replays/" target="_blank">stored here</a>. You can adjust whether your
          replays are saved publicly in the Panel Attack options menu.
          They are arranged into folders by Panel Attack version, then date (UTC time), then player names.
          <br><br>Once you have downloaded the file for the replay you want to watch, copy it to <span
            class="code">%appdata%\Panel Attack\replays</span>, then relaunch panel attack and find it with the Replay
          Browser at the main menu.
