    <h2 id="there-is-a-new-updater-for-panel-attack-">There is a new updater for Panel Attack!</h1>
    <p>You can find out about what is changing below and also why things are changing</p>


    <h1 id="changes">Changes</h1>

    <h2 id="for-all-operating-systems">For all operating systems</h2>
    <p>
      If you have been on the discord you will know that we have 3 release streams at the moment.<br>
      When using the new updater you can now change the release stream in the Options -> General menu so you no longer need multiple updaters.
    </p>
    <a href="images/migration/releaseStreamSelection.png"><img height="104" src="images/migration/releaseStreamSelection.png" alt="Picking the release stream in the options menu"/></a>


    <h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
    <p>
      If you have many mods installed you may have been experiencing cryptic graphics-related crashes.<br>
      This happened because the old client was made for 32-bit systems. (strongly simplified explanation)<br>
      The new updater is made for 64-bit systems and these crashes should no longer occur.<br>
      The minimum Windows version to run Panel Attack is now Windows 7 SP1 (64 bit).
    </p>


    <h2 id="macos-and-linux">MacOS and Linux</h2>
    <p>Panel Attack now comes as a native app that you can simply doubleclick to run!  </p>
    <p>Because they are now native apps, the save directory is moving up by one directory.  </p>
    <a href="images/migration/savedirmove.png"><img height="240" src="images/migration/savedirmove.png" alt="New save dir location in a file tree"/></a>
    
    <p>The game will try to automatically migrate your old save directory on first start with the new updater.  </p>
    <a href="images/migration/migration.png"><img height="180" src="images/migration/migration.png" alt="Panel Attack migrating the save directory on startup"/></a>
    
    <p>Additionally the minimum version to run Panel Attack on Mac is now 10.15 (Catalina).</p>


    <h2 id="android">Android</h2>
    <p>
      Panel Attack now comes as a native apk that you can sideload on your device.<br>
      If you were using the test version for touch inputs, this version should cleanly update it.<br>
      If you ready up using touch, the game should automatically switch into portrait mode on game start.<br>
      The game will also (finally!) respect your rotation lock setting with the new updater.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Old data from installs launched with the LOVE app unfortunately cannot be transferred due to android&#39;s filesystem restrictions :-(<br>
      You can try to move the data manually but whether you will succeed will depend on your device, your OS version, your skill and some luck, no guarantees.
    </p>


    <h1 id="why-">Why?</h1>
    <p>
      The Panel Attack server now supports https but our updater does not!<br>
      The new updater supports https and will allow us to remove http support from our website.<br>
      Additionally, the new updater upgrades the version of the game framework we use for Panel Attack to the next major version.<br>
